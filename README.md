Application for the manipulation of gravitational biomes.
This thesis aims to explore the conjecture of straying electrons in reference to cosmic correlaons(phi) between microgravitaonal spectrums. The study will invesgate the interacons betweenelectrons that are decomposed from their original atomic nucleus and the cosmic correlaonbetween them. The research will also analyze the gravatomic spectrum in microgravitaonal biomes,such as quasars and black holes. The study will be conducted using a combinaon of theoretical andexperimental methods.
